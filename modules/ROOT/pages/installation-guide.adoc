= Installing Silverblue

Fedora Silverblue can be installed in the standard manner, and the official 
Fedora installation guide can be followed for your Fedora version: see the 
https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/docs/[Fedora documentation site] for more 
details.

[[before-you-begin]]
== Before you begin

As with installing any new operating system, it is important to back up
any data that you want to save before starting, and have a clear 
understanding of the consequences of what you are doing.

While Silverblue is intended to provide the full range of capabilities as a 
regular Fedora Workstation, it is a different type of system and some things 
are different. Therefore, if you have any important or specific needs it is 
recommended to check that Silverblue can satisfy them before you install. This 
can include particular applications that you might require or technical 
abilitise for developers. Silverblue can be tested in a virtual machine prior 
to installation.

*It is important to be aware that Silverblue does not provide a fully 
functional experience for dual booting or manual partitioning, including 
seperate home partitions.*

It is possible to make Silverblue work for both dual boot and manual 
partitioning, and some guidance is provided on manual partitioning below. 
However, there are hazards involved in both cases, and you should only attempt 
to use these features if you have done the necessary research, and are 
confident that you can overcome any issues you might encounter.

[[getting-silverblue]]
== Getting Silverblue

If you are using Fedora Media Writer, Silverblue should be listed as a 
download option. However, if it isn't, or if you want to download it manually, 
an install image can be downloaded from 
https://silverblue.fedoraproject.org/[the main Silverblue website].

Once you have got your copy of Silverblue, it can be installed in the usual 
manner. We hope that you love it!

[[manual-partition]]
== Manual Partitioning

As described above, there are known issues with manual partitioning on 
Silverblue, and it should be used with caution. The following notes are 
intended as hints for those attempting it, rather than recommended practice.

With Silverblue, only certain mounts can be manually specified as 
partitions. These include:

* `/boot`
* `/var`
* Subdirectories under `/var`, including:
** `/var/home` (Silverblue has a symlink from `/home` to `/var/home`)
** `/var/log`
** `/var/containers`
* The root filesystem: `/`

The Fedora installer is not aware of these restrictions and will accept 
custom partitions without error, even if they are incompatible with 
Silverblue. This makes custom partitioning with Silverblue hazardous.

The above screenshot shown a typical configuration with manual partitioning, 
with partitions for `/boot`, `/`, `swap` and `/var/home`.

Manual partitioning on Silverblue can be done with 
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logical_Volume_Manager_%28Linux%29[LVM], as well 
as standard partitions or an `xfs` filesystem.
